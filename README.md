[a link](https://medium.com/@lingrajsv1998/bootstrapping-bfda22490b1a) 
This repository focuses on understanding the bootstrapping concepts and its implementation with python. In this we have discussed two use cases:
1. Bootstrapping with random number of samples drawn from a normal distribution and estimating its 'mean'.
2. Estimating the accuracy of a ML model.

## Requirements:
1. Dataset: Diabetes classification dataset file.
2. Packages:
   1. pandas 
   2. Numpy
   3. sklearn
   4. matplotlib
   5. seaborn

Implementation explains the following contents:

1. What is Bootstrapping?</b>
2. What is Bootstrap Sampling? Why we need it?</b>
3. Demo on Random data </b> 
4. usecase on Real data</b> 
5. Advantages & Disadvanatges</b> 
6. What Next?

Run bootstrap_implementation.ipynb in jupyter console.
